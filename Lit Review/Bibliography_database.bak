Function to define the traditional aerospike nozzle contour for isentropic, inviscid, irrotational supersonic flows

isentropic area ratios for the selected fluid and desired exit Mach number. The accuracy of the nozzle to
produce the desired exit Mach number is also checked. The flow field of the nozzle created by the code is
independently checked with the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code ANSYS-FLUENT.
ANSYS- FLUENT predictions are used to verify the isentropic flow assumption and that the working fluid
reached the user-defined desired exit Mach number. Good agreement in area ratio and exit Mach number is
going to be achieved, verifying that the code is accurate.},

Initially the aims of the project were to first get the engine running and then to carry out as comprehensive a testing programme as the timescale allowed. This was to include off design point testing as well as work on combustion stability and efficency. However as work progressed several problems came to light and these eventually led to the abandoning of the testing option. This resulted in the project becoming more of a design exercise which would provide a basis for further work. This report includes a design method for axisymmetric De Laval nozzles usign a computer program.},

  Abstract                 = {A ram jet engine is a device from which usefuI thrust can be obtained by creating a velocity difference between the atmosphere entering the ram jet body and the same quantity of air leaving the ram jet body. This velocity difference between entrance and exit air is accomplished by the addition of heat to that portion of the airstream flowing through the ram jet body. Burning liquid fuel inside the ram jet body is one means of adding heat to a ducted airstream and is the only method with which this monograph will be concerned.
The ram jet engine is composed of three major components: a body structure, fuel injection system, and a flame stabilization system. A poor design of any one of these parts will nullify a good design of the other components. In order to build a good performing engine all three components must be of proper design because of their close relation and dependence upon each other.},

meant to state what the ground rules are for the software to be written: how it should be

little consensus on what a good coding standard is. Among the many that have been
written there are remarkable few patterns to discern, except that each new document
tends to be longer than the one before it. The result is that most existing guidelines
contain well over a hundred rules, sometimes with questionable justification. Some rules,
especially those that try to stipulate the use of white-space in programs, may have been
introduced by personal preference; others are meant to prevent very specific and unlikely
types of error from earlier coding efforts within the same organization. Not surprisingly,
the existing coding guidelines tend to have little effect on what developers actually do
when they write code. The most dooming aspect of many of the guidelines is that they
rarely allow for comprehensive tool-based compliance checks. Tool-based checks are
important, since it is often infeasible to manually review the hundreds of thousands of
lines of code that are written for larger applications.},

axisymmetric aerospike nozzle in comparison with the equivalent conventional (convergent-
divergent) nozzle through numerical simulation, and to study the effects of geometrical
parameters on the aerospike’s performance. Internal and external flow of the aerospike nozzle
and the equivalent conventional nozzle has been numerically analyzed in different ratios of
ambient pressure to design exhaust pressure (P atm /P des ) representing optimum, under- and
over-expansion working conditions. Results indicate that the aerospike nozzle can deliver as
much as 5% more thrust in over-expansion conditions. To address practical aspects of using
an aerospike nozzle, effects of geometric parameters including base curvature, and different
values of plug truncation ranging from 0 to 75%, on thrust and base temperature distribution
of the nozzle have been studied. Results show that higher values of base truncation are more
appropriate for flight at altitudes higher than design altitude (under-expansion condition),
while lower values are more appropriate for flight below design altitude. It has also been
shown that adding curvature to the base of a truncated plug can improve local temperature
distribution without any significant effect on thrust.},

primary flow rate and overall thrust were measured.
Both nozzles are efficient at the cruising condition (M~ = 2-0) and both are exceptionally flexible with
regard to off-design operation (Moo = 0.9 and 0). However, at Moo = 0.9 and 2.0, the overall thrust of

  Abstract                 = {A table of recommended rate constants for gas phase chemical reactions occurring in combustion is presented. Specifically it gives in tabular form the values of the parameters for the modified Arrhenius equation k=AT^Bexp(-E/RT). The table covers reactions occuring in the combustion, oxidation and decomposition of aliphatic saturated or unsaturated C1 to C10 hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, thiols, ethers, peroxides, amines, amides and their free radicals, as well as the reactions of O, O2, H, H2, OH, H2O, H2O2, N, N2, NO, N2O, NO2, N2O4, N2O3, S, S2, SH, SO, SO2, SOH, NS, with each other. The table contains 169 first order reactions, 782 second order reactions, and 57 third order reactions. There are 1770 entries covering 1008 distinct chemical reactions. These recommendations have been taken from eleven evaluations and critical reviews published between 1970 and 1976. The papers examined by the evaluators extend from the nineteen fifties up to and including 1975.},

  Abstract                 = {The future of aerospace is supersonic and a supersonic wind tunnel is the fundamental requirement of
the day. This design will help build small scale and large scale supersonic wind tunnels for testing objects such
as the spikes used in the fore section of supersonic aircrafts, and shock absorbing objects etc. Shocks are evident
in a supersonic flow and when air passes through a shock, the velocity reduces and thus not allowing the speed
to be maintained constant throughout the section and also reducing the efficiency of the wind tunnel. By using
the Method of characteristics, we assume characteristic points and see to it that the shocks, if formed will be in
contact with the surface and does not affect the uniformity of the flow through the duct and the velocity of the
flow. A thorough understanding of the method of characteristics and its application to the design of supersonic
wind tunnel nozzle is required. We make use of the Area-Mach relation, Prandtl Mayer spread sheet solver and
other tools to define 64 coordinates in the supersonic section of the nozzle, including the internal points. The
Wind Tunnel has been designed in CATIA v5 and the coordinates of the supersonic section of the wind tunnel
have been obtained from MS Excel by doing the calculations and using its Goal Seek feature to simplify very
complicated equation. The contour of the supersonic section of the wind tunnel is so designed that the shocks
cancel each other, the shocks do not affect the velocity of the flow in order to obtain supersonic flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to the changing state of the art in ramjet propulsion and in missile weaponeering, the ramjet engineer is confronted frequently with the need to estimate corresponding improvements in ramjet performance. The basic point design performance characteristics through the Mach number range of 1.3 to 5.0 are presented graphically for a wide variation in component efficiencies. Thus, as component (diffusers, combustor, nozzle etc.) performance characteristics change as a result of either advances in the state of the art or modified flight conditions, the new thrust and specific impulse levels can be estimated. The results given apply only to hydrocarbon fuels.},
