\begin_layout Title
Additively Manufactured Engine Lowering Inefficiency at Altitude (AMELIA)
 - Project Plan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Peter Senior
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
2015-09-xx
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Project Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project aims to design, build and test a ramjet combustor and nozzle
 capable of producing a net thrust at its design conditions.
 An extension is to ensure the engine operates well at off-design conditions,
 for example higher or lower speeds and atmospheric pressures.
 The supply nozzle and intake will be designed in a separate project, but
 the two projects will work together closely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To allow the use of complex shapes in the design and to reduce manufacturing
 costs in the long term the engine will be constructed primarily through
 additive manufacturing, also known as 3D-Printing.
 3D Printing is also more environmentally conscious than subtractive manufacturi
ng (such as the use of a lathe or chisel), as it substantially reduces waste
 produced.
 When a sufficiently capable machine is used, final manufactured items can
 be far more intricate and complex than items made by hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computational Fluid Dynamics will be used to design and optimise the engine
 before manufacture, in order to increase the performance achieved without
 having to iterate on a physical design.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to carry out what is a highly ambitious project the design process
 will be arranged so that a viable solution is produced as soon as possible.
 This solution will then be matured over time to give increased performance
 before a decision is made after the interim report whether to go ahead
 with construction.
 The project will be structured around the CADMID (Concept, Assessment,
 Demonstration, Manufacture, In-Service, Disposal) cycle which is standard
 for UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) projects.
 A brief overview of the CADMID cycle is contained in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-CADMID-Cycle"

\end_inset

.
 The CADMID cycle will be used because it has been demonstrated by the MoD
 to be effective for the management of projects with a single final manufactured
 solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is envisaged that time spent maturing the design will focus on the combustion
 chamber, as this is considered the highest risk component.
 This is because the majority of work done advancing combustion chamber
 technology is highly proprietary in nature.
 Basic combustion chambers are however easy to design, however they are
 often extremely inefficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Major Risks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several major hurdles to be overcome during the life of this project:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Personal training:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This project will leverage Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) a great deal.
 Accurate and reliable use of CFD requires significant levels of training,
 alongside a good level of understanding of the underlying theory.
 Effective use of CFD is as much an art form as it is a science.
 It must be ensured that personal training is at a sufficient level that
 major mistakes are not made early in the project which are costly to rectify
 later on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If this project goes to manufacture it will utilise two pressurised gas
 systems (pressurised air and a pressurised gas fuel supply).
 It is vital from a safety perspective that training in the use of these
 systems has been completed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This project will involve the installation and running of the engine in
 the engine test cells, this will require training in the engine test cell
 procedures.
 Training may also be required in workshop use and possibly welding.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Safety hazards:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This project may use a high-voltage spark for ignition.
 This is a safety hazard and must be taken into account with regards to
 risk assessment and training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This project will use combustible materials in an untested system.
 There is therefore a significant risk of fire, and a slight risk of explosion.
 This must be taken into account at all stages of the project, particularly
 so that the system fails safely.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Design process hazards:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If a workable solution cannot be created in the time constraints, or the
 project sponsor is not sufficiently satisfied with the design, there is
 the option to extend the demonstration phase past the interim design review,
 and to push back the manufacturing date.
 This would have the knock-on effect of curtailing (or removing altogether)
 testing time.
 If the design is still not sufficiently mature then the physical construction
 of the engine may not occur at all.
 Obviously this is not a preferred option.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Section
Project Timeline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project timeline is synchronised to the milestones detailed by the Universit
y, however it is hoped milestones will be delivered early so that the project
 can be more rapidly progressed towards the manufacturing and testing phase
 where the greatest time constraints lie - it has been advised that available
 time in the engine test cells is limited.

The CADMID Cycle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CADMID cycle is broken down into six stages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Concept
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In the Concept phase the need for a project is identified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Options for possible solutions to the problem are identified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In this project's context, the literature review is contained here, primarily.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Assessment
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In the Assessment phase the requirements are defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A single solution to the problem is identified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In this project, the final geometry will be defined here, along with a broad
 description of the control system's architecture.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Demonstration
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In the Demonstration phase the solution to the requirements is defined more
 fully, and is used to demonstrate the compliance of the final solution
 with the requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In this project full CFD simulation will be used here to demonstrate efficiency,
 and the miscellaneous components of the control system will be defined
 and included.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Manufacture
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In the Manufacturing phase the final solution is built and validated.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In-service
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This phase begins when the project's output is accepted into use, and the
 project is monitored for obsolescence issues.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Disposal
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In this phase the obsolete solution is removed from use in such a way as
 to minimise the impact on the user and the environment.
